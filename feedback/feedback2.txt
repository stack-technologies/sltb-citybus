Good

Highly appreciate this work for a best solution infront of traffic cases in week days......Good job well done!!!

Valuable service.... Comfortable and Friendly .. Please continue this service üëåüëå


Please promote this service more to increase the public awareness.. 

This is really helpful to us as usual users of galagedara peradeniya route.

Followings are my suggestions for success of this in Kandy area.

Publicity campaign to be implemented to aware the service of route Galagedara - Kadugnnawa. Few people No about this service.

The service will not profitable at the initial stage. But will make profit when people awareness is high and people familiar with the service. As such buses to be run on schedule even with the less passenger at the initial stage.

Frequency at peak hours and non- peak hours can be further increased or reduced by doing passenger survey.

Following new routes also will be benefitted for public if can started.

1. Alawathugoda - Kadugannawa.
2. Alawathugoda - Digana
3. Galagedara - Digana
4. Gampola - Digana
5. Gampola - Galagedara

Other thing is provision of parking areas at terminal points and key nodal points for park and ride facility.

Wish success of the service for betterment of the public.

Thank you
